## MNIST Fashion Data Classification Task

* The aim of this study is to find the best classifier to train a machine learning model that will be used to predict the content of pictures. By using the pixel breakdown of thousands of pictures, the model will attempt to classify each picture into its correct class. This report will focus on pictures of the following 10 clothing items: T-shirt/Top, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags and ankle boots. The aim of this model will be to train it using 30,000 pictures with assigned labels and then testing it on a further 5,000 pictures. Ideally, this model will be able to be fed any picture in the future and it will be able predict which of the 10 items listed above the picture is depicting.

* The following three models were created:
1. K-Nearest Neighbour
2. Naive Bayes
3. Neural Network

* Results:
